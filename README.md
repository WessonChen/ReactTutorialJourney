### Components
1. Components describe a part of the user interface
2. They are re-usable and can be nested inside other components
3. Two types of components:
    - Stateless Functional Components
        ```javascript
        function Welcome(props) {
            return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>
        }
        ```
    - Stateful Class Components
        ```javascript
        class Welcome extends React.Component (
            render() {
                return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
            }
        )
        ```

### Functional Components vs Class Components
1. Functional components
    - Simple functions
    - Use Func components as much as possible (quicker)
    - Absence of `this` keyword
    - Solution without using `state`
    - Mainly responsible for the UI
    - Also called Stateless/Dumb/Presentational components
2. Class components
    - More feature rich
    - Maintain their own **private** date - state
    - Complex UI logic
    - Provide lifecycle hooks
    - Also called Stateful/Smart/Container components
